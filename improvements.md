I created a new file called queries.sql to store all the mysql queries used in this code repository. These are the improvements need to be done regarding `CREATE TABLE apartments` mysql query:
1. let's name this table as 'real_estate_properties' instead of 'apartments'. Because I've an idea to extend this table to collect data for other types of properties like land, office areas, houses and so on in future.
2. so let's add a new column 'property_type' with ENUM values like 'apartment', 'house', 'land', 'office' to identify the type of property.
3. make id auto increment primary key.
4. My main intention of this work is to store rental property data in sri lanka, specially colombo. and after collecting considerable amount of data (rows in this real_estate_properties table) like 1000000, I'm planning to train a machine learning model to identify patterns in these data, and analyze them. So when collecting the data, it's better if we collect data in numerical/ boolian (either 1 or 0) format rather than text format. for the categorical type data, let's create seperate tables to store those categorical data and link them with foreign keys. So please modify the below query accordingly.
